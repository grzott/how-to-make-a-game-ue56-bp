# Mass Entity Framework: Blueprint Integration (UE 5.6)

What/Why: Leverage UE5.6's Mass Entity system for high-performance crowd simulation, AI, and procedural content through Blueprint interfaces.

Prereqs

- Plugins: Mass Entity, Mass Gameplay, Mass AI
- Understanding of Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture

Steps

1. Mass Entity Blueprint Setup

- Create `Mass Processor` Blueprint: inherit from `UMassProcessor`
- Define `Entity Query` with required components: `FMassMovementFragment`, `FMassVelocityFragment`
- Implement `ConfigureQueries()` to specify component filters and access patterns

2. Blueprint-Accessible Components

- Create `USTRUCT` components for Blueprint data: `FBlueprintCrowdData { float WalkSpeed; FVector Destination; }`
- Register with `Mass Entity Subsystem` via `RegisterComponentType()`
- Use `Mass Entity Manager` Blueprint nodes to spawn/despawn entities

3. Crowd Movement System

- `BP_CrowdMovementProcessor`: updates entity positions based on velocity
- Query entities with `Movement + Velocity` components
- Calculate steering behaviors: `Seek`, `Separate`, `Align` using Vector math
- Update positions: `NewPosition = CurrentPosition + (Velocity * DeltaTime)`

4. Blueprint AI Integration

- Create `BP_CrowdBehaviorProcessor` for decision making
- Use `Blackboard Component` data in Mass context for AI states
- Trigger Blueprint events when entities enter specific areas or states
- Interface with Behavior Trees via `Mass Behavior Tree` processor

5. LOD and Performance Scaling

- Implement `Mass LOD` processor with distance-based detail levels
- Far entities: update at 1Hz with simple movement
- Near entities: update at 10Hz with full AI and animation
- Use `Significance Manager` for Blueprint-driven importance calculation

6. Visual Representation

- `Mass Representation` processor spawns Actors for visible entities
- Use `Instanced Static Mesh` for far LODs (hundreds of entities)
- Switch to full `Character` Actors for near interactions
- Blueprint-driven spawning based on entity data and LOD requirements

7. Blueprint Event Integration

- Create `Mass Signal` system for Blueprint-to-Mass communication
- Events: `OnCrowdMemberInteracted`, `OnDestinationReached`, `OnCombatStarted`
- Mass processors can trigger Blueprint delegates for game logic responses

Data

- `DA_CrowdArchetype`: entity templates with component sets and default values
- `DA_MassLODSettings`: distance thresholds and update frequencies per LOD level

Networking

- Mass entities don't replicate directly; replicate high-level state instead
- Use `Mass Network` processor for critical entities requiring synchronization
- Clients simulate local Mass systems; server sends corrections for important entities

Performance

- Target: 1000+ entities at 60fps on console hardware
- Budget: 2-3ms per frame for Mass processing on main thread
- Memory: ~100KB per 1000 entities (component data only)

Testing

- Spawn 500-2000 crowd entities in test map
- Validate LOD transitions don't cause visual pops or performance spikes
- Test Blueprint event triggering under load (interaction, combat, scripted events)

## Advanced Patterns

1. Procedural Content Generation

- Use Mass entities for procedural object placement (rocks, vegetation)
- Blueprint rules for density, distribution, and variation
- Runtime streaming: spawn/despawn based on player proximity

2. Combat Integration

- Mass-based projectiles for high-volume combat (bullet hell, explosions)
- Entity health and damage components processed in Mass
- Interface with GAS for ability effects on Mass entities

3. Optimization Techniques

- Spatial partitioning with Mass chunks for localized processing
- Blueprint job system integration for async Mass operations
- Memory pooling for component allocation/deallocation
