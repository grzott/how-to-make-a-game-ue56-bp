    SC->>IC: Validate Input Method
    
    alt Input Valid
        IC->>SC: Input Confirmed
        SC->>ST: Check Current State
        
        alt State Change Allowed
            ST->>TC: Start Activation Timer
            TC->>ST: Timer Complete
            ST->>SC: State Changed
            SC->>ED: Broadcast State Change
        else State Change Blocked
            ST->>SC: Change Denied
            SC->>ED: Broadcast Activation Failed
        end
    else Input Invalid
        IC->>SC: Input Rejected
        SC->>ED: Broadcast Invalid Input
    end
```

### Multi-Switch Sequence Pattern

- **Input Pooling**: Batch process multiple switch inputs efficiently
- **Priority System**: Critical switches get immediate processing

### State Management
- **Delta Updates**: Only process switches that have changed state
- **Spatial Optimization**: Only check switches within player proximity
- **Batch Notifications**: Group state change events for efficiency

### Sequence Processing
- **Early Termination**: Stop processing invalid sequences immediately
