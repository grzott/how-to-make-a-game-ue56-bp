        end
    else Discovery Invalid
        DS->>HS: Consider Hint Display
    end
    
    note over DS: Multiple discovery methods supported
    note over CC: Smooth reveal animations maintain immersion
```

### Progressive Revelation Pattern
- **Staged Discovery**: Secrets revealed in multiple phases for complex areas
- **Dependency Chains**: Some secrets unlock others in logical sequences
- **Context Sensitivity**: Discovery methods that fit the environment and story

### Hint Delivery Pattern
- **Subtle Integration**: Environmental clues that don't break immersion
- **Escalating Obviousness**: Hints become more direct if player struggles
- **Player Agency**: Players can choose to ignore or seek additional hints

## Performance Optimization

### Detection Optimization
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Efficient proximity detection using spatial data structures
- **Condition Caching**: Cache expensive condition evaluations
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Only check conditions when relevant events occur

### Concealment Optimization
- **LOD Concealment**: Reduce concealment complexity for distant secret areas
- **Culling System**: Only process concealment for player-visible areas  
- **Animation Pooling**: Reuse reveal animations and effects efficiently

### Memory Management
- **Asset Streaming**: Load secret area content on-demand
- **State Compression**: Efficient storage of discovery states
- **History Pruning**: Clean up old discovery data that's no longer relevant
