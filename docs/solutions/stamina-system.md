    participant FC as Fatigue Controller
    
    P->>SM: Request Action
    SM->>CS: Check Stamina Cost
    CS->>RC: Query Available Stamina
    
    alt Sufficient Stamina
        RC->>CS: Stamina Available
        CS->>RC: Consume Stamina
        RC->>SM: Update Stamina State
        SM->>P: Action Approved
        SM->>RS: Check Recovery State
    else Insufficient Stamina
        RC->>SM: Stamina Insufficient
        SM->>FC: Check Fatigue State
        FC->>SM: Apply Exhaustion Effects
        SM->>P: Action Denied
    end
    
    note over RS: Recovery runs continuously
    note over FC: Exhaustion affects all systems
```

### Recovery Pattern
- **Passive Recovery**: Automatic stamina regeneration during normal activity
