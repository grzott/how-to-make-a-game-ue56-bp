## Technical Excellence Framework

### Blueprint Architecture Mastery

**Core Principles (DRY, KISS, SOLID for Visual Scripting)**:
```
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
- Component-based architecture over Blueprint inheritance
- Data Asset configuration instead of hardcoded values
- Interface contracts for reusable communication patterns

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
- Single responsibility per Blueprint class
- Clear naming conventions (BP_PlayerController, AC_HealthComponent)
- Visual flow that reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom

SOLID (Applied to Visual Scripting):
- Single Responsibility: One Blueprint = One clear purpose
- Open/Closed: Extend via Components, not modification
- Liskov Substitution: Interface implementations are interchangeable
- Interface Segregation: Focused Blueprint Interfaces, not monolithic
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions (Interfaces), not concrete Blueprints
```

**Modern UE5.6 System Integration**:
- **Enhanced Input System**: Context-driven input with Player Mappable Configs
- **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**: Scalable abilities, attributes, effects, cooldowns
- **UI MVVM Architecture**: ViewModels separate logic from presentation
- **World Partition**: Large-world streaming with seamless level transitions  
- **Nanite/Lumen**: Dynamic quality scaling for cross-platform performance
- **Mass Entity Framework**: High-performance crowd systems and procedural content

### Performance Excellence Standards

**Memory Management**:
- **Soft References**: TSoftObjectPtr for optional heavy assets
- **Async Loading**: Streamable Manager for on-demand content
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse frequently spawned actors (projectiles, effects)
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper cleanup in EndPlay, avoid circular references

**CPU Optimization**:
- **Event-Driven**: Eliminate Tick functions, use Timers and Delegates
- **Batch Operations**: Group expensive calculations, spread across frames
- **LOD Systems**: Distance-based complexity reduction
- **Profiling-Guided**: Use Unreal Insights, Stat commands for measurable optimization

**Network Architecture**:
- **Authority Validation**: Server-authoritative gameplay logic
- **Minimal Replication**: Only replicate essential state changes
- **Prediction**: Client-side prediction for responsive gameplay
- **Compression**: Efficient data serialization for bandwidth optimization
