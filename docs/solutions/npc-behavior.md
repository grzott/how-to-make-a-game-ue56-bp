# NPC Behavior System

## Overview
An intelligent NPC behavior system providing realistic AI characters with daily routines, emotional responses, social interactions, and dynamic decision-making. Implements behavior trees, state machines, goal-oriented action planning, and social hierarchies while maintaining performance for large populations of NPCs.

## Blueprint Patterns

### NPC Decision Flow
```mermaid

    participant NPC as NPC Character
    participant BC as Behavior Controller
    participant SS as Schedule System
    participant SC as Social Controller
    participant ES as Emotion System
    participant MS as Memory System
    
    NPC->>BC: Request Next Action
    BC->>SS: Check Current Schedule
    SS->>BC: Return Scheduled Activity
    
    BC->>ES: Check Emotional State
    ES->>BC: Return Current Mood
    
    BC->>MS: Query Relevant Memories
    MS->>BC: Return Contextual Data
    
    BC->>SC: Check Social Obligations
    SC->>BC: Return Social Priorities
    
    BC->>BC: Evaluate Behavior Options
    BC->>NPC: Execute Chosen Action
    
    note over BC: Multi-factor decision making
    note over NPC: Actions affect all systems
```

### Social Interaction Pattern
- **Relationship Awareness**: NPCs track relationships with other characters and player
- **Context-Sensitive Dialog**: Conversations adapt to relationship status and recent events
- **Group Behavior**: NPCs coordinate activities and respond to group dynamics

### Memory Formation Pattern
- **Event Recording**: Significant events stored with emotional context
- **Memory Decay**: Older memories fade or become less accurate over time
- **Shared Information**: NPCs share information through social networks

## Performance Optimization

### AI Processing Optimization
- **Level of Detail**: Reduce AI complexity based on distance from player
- **Time Slicing**: Distribute AI processing across multiple frames
- **Priority Queuing**: Important NPCs get more processing time

### Crowd Management
- **Population Culling**: Deactivate distant NPCs with graceful reactivation
- **Group Processing**: Process similar NPCs in batches efficiently
- **Behavioral Instancing**: Share similar behaviors across multiple NPCs

### Memory Optimization
- **Memory Compression**: Efficient storage of NPC memories and relationships
- **Relevance Filtering**: Only store memories that affect future behavior
- **Garbage Collection**: Clean up outdated or irrelevant NPC data
