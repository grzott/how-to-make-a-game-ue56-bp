# Guide overview (for CG artists)

This guide is written for experienced CG artists with junior UE 5.6 UI skills and no programming background. It translates production‑proven patterns into concrete Blueprint steps.

- Why patterns matter for large teams and content‑heavy projects
- Map CG concepts (materials, animation, lighting) to gameplay systems you can build
- Battle‑tested patterns: input, UI (MVVM), saving, async loading, performance, and multiplayer
- Copy‑paste checklists and page templates for each feature slice

Quick start

1) Read the Essentials page to learn the official terms we’ll use.
2) Open the AAA Blueprint Patterns and follow the recipes.
