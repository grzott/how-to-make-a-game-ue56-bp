    P->>PC: Attempt Puzzle Move
    PC->>VS: Validate Move
    
    alt Valid Move
        VS->>PC: Move Accepted
        PC->>PT: Record Progress
        PC->>VS: Check Solution
        
        alt Puzzle Solved
            VS->>PC: Solution Complete
            PC->>RC: Trigger Rewards
            RC->>P: Grant Rewards
        else Puzzle Incomplete
            VS->>PC: Continue Puzzle
            PC->>HS: Check Hint Triggers
        end
    else Invalid Move
        VS->>PC: Move Rejected
        PC->>P: Show Error Feedback
        PC->>PT: Record Failure
        PC->>HS: Consider Hint Trigger
    end
    
    note over HS: Hints triggered by struggle patterns
    note over PT: Progress affects difficulty and hints
```

### Difficulty Scaling Pattern
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Puzzle complexity adjusts based on player performance
- **Progressive Complexity**: Later puzzles build on earlier concepts
- **Player Skill Assessment**: System learns player strengths and weaknesses

### Hint Progression Pattern
- **Subtle Guidance**: Initial hints provide gentle nudges without spoilers
- **Progressive Detail**: Subsequent hints become more specific and direct
- **Solution Prevention**: Final hints guide without giving away complete solution

## Performance Optimization

### Algorithm Optimization
- **Solution Caching**: Pre-calculate solutions for commonly encountered states
- **Early Termination**: Stop validation as soon as result is determined
- **Incremental Validation**: Only validate changed portions of puzzle state

### UI Performance
- **Lazy Rendering**: Only render visible puzzle elements and interactions
- **Animation Pooling**: Reuse animation components for similar puzzle effects
- **Event Batching**: Group similar puzzle events for efficient processing

### Memory Management
- **State Compression**: Efficient storage of puzzle states and progress
- **Asset Streaming**: Load puzzle assets on-demand based on proximity
- **History Pruning**: Limit stored puzzle history to relevant data points
