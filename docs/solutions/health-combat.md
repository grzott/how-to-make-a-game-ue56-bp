    participant A as Attacker
    participant CM as Combat Manager
    participant DS as Damage System
    participant AS as Armor System
    participant HC as Health Controller
    participant SE as Status Effects
    
    A->>CM: Initiate Attack
    CM->>DS: Calculate Base Damage
    DS->>AS: Apply Armor Reduction
    AS->>DS: Return Modified Damage
    DS->>SE: Apply Status Modifiers
    SE->>DS: Return Final Damage
    DS->>HC: Apply Damage to Target
    HC->>CM: Report Damage Result
    CM->>A: Provide Combat Feedback
    
    alt Target Defeated
        HC->>CM: Trigger Death State
        CM->>A: Award Combat Rewards
    end
    
    note over DS: Complex damage calculations with multiple modifiers
    note over HC: Health changes trigger various game systems
```

### Status Effect Pattern
- **Effect Stacking**: Multiple effects can stack with diminishing returns

- **Turn Management**: Real-time or turn-based combat flow control
- **Interrupt Systems**: Special abilities that can interrupt normal flow

## Performance Optimization

### Damage Calculation Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple damage instances efficiently
- **Early Termination**: Skip unnecessary calculations for defeated targets

### Combat Participant Management
- **Active Culling**: Only process combat for active participants
- **Priority Systems**: Important combats get more processing time
- **Distance Optimization**: Reduce combat detail for distant battles

### Effect Management
- **Effect Pooling**: Reuse status effect objects efficiently
- **Update Batching**: Process similar effects together
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only calculate effect values when needed
