## Blueprint Patterns

### Door Interaction Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Player
    participant DM as Door Manager
    participant AC as Access Controller
    participant LC as Lock Controller
    participant AN as Animation Controller
    participant AU as Audio Controller
    
    P->>DM: Attempt Door Interaction
    DM->>AC: Check Access Permissions
    
    alt Access Granted
        AC->>DM: Permission Approved
        DM->>AN: Start Open Animation
        DM->>AU: Play Open Sound
        AN->>DM: Animation Complete
    else Access Denied - Locked
        AC->>LC: Check Lock Status
        LC->>AC: Return Lock Type
        AC->>DM: Display Lock UI
        DM->>AU: Play Lock Rattle Sound
    else Access Denied - Security
        AC->>DM: Access Forbidden
        DM->>AU: Play Access Denied Sound
    end
```

### Lock Type Pattern
- **Hierarchical Locks**: Different lock types with specific requirements
- **Progressive Access**: Locks that become easier with player progression
- **Failure Consequences**: Lock attempt failures trigger security responses

### State Machine Pattern
- **Door States**: Closed, Opening, Open, Closing, Locked, Jammed, Destroyed
- **Transition Rules**: Valid state transitions with animation blending
- **State Persistence**: Maintain door states across game sessions

## Performance Optimization

### Animation Optimization
- **Distance LOD**: Reduce animation quality for distant doors
- **Occlusion Culling**: Skip animations for non-visible doors
- **Animation Pooling**: Reuse animation components efficiently

### Audio Optimization
- **Spatial Audio**: 3D positioned door sounds with realistic falloff
- **Priority System**: Important doors get full audio treatment
- **Audio Culling**: Disable audio for very distant door interactions

### State Management
- **Lazy Updates**: Only update door states when player is nearby
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple door states efficiently
- **Memory Optimization**: Compact state representation for many doors
