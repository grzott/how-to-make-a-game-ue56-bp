## Blueprint Patterns

### Container Interaction Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Player
    participant CM as Container Manager
    participant AC as Access Controller
    participant SC as Storage Controller
    participant UI as UI Controller
    participant AN as Animation Controller
    
    P->>CM: Request Container Access
    CM->>AC: Check Access Permissions
    
    alt Access Granted
        AC->>CM: Permission Approved
        CM->>AN: Start Open Animation
        CM->>SC: Load Container Contents
        SC->>UI: Display Container Interface
        AN->>UI: Animation Complete
    else Access Denied
        AC->>CM: Access Forbidden
        CM->>UI: Display Lock Interface
    end
    
    loop Container Open
        P->>UI: Perform Item Actions
        UI->>SC: Process Item Operations
        SC->>CM: Update Container State
    end
    
    P->>UI: Close Container
    UI->>AN: Start Close Animation
    UI->>SC: Save Container State
```

### Loot Generation Pattern
- **Dynamic Generation**: Procedural loot based on container type and player level
- **Rarity Distribution**: Weighted random generation with luck modifiers
- **Context-Sensitive**: Loot appropriate to container location and story context

### Multi-Access Pattern
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple players can access same container simultaneously
- **Action Queuing**: Queue conflicting actions for fair resolution
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time updates across all accessing players

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- **Lazy Loading**: Load container contents only when accessed
- **Smart Caching**: Cache frequently accessed container data
- **Garbage Collection**: Clean up unused container instances efficiently

### UI Optimization
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficiently display large container inventories
- **Incremental Search**: Real-time search with minimal performance impact
- **UI Pooling**: Reuse UI elements for multiple containers

### Network Optimization
- **Delta Synchronization**: Only send changed container data
- **Priority Queuing**: Important container changes get transmission priority
- **Compression**: Compress container state data for network efficiency
