## What & Why

Modern adventure games require sophisticated inventory management that feels intuitive to players while providing developers with flexible, extensible architecture. This system combines the spatial organization of grid-based storage with intelligent categorization, creating an inventory that scales from simple item collection to complex equipment management.

## Prerequisites

- **Enhanced Input System** for drag-and-drop interactions
- **UI MVVM Architecture** understanding for clean data binding
- **Data Asset** patterns for item and configuration management
- **Component Architecture** familiarity for modular design

## Component Architecture

### Core System Components

**AC_InventoryComponent** (Actor Component)
- Manages individual character's inventory state and operations
- Handles item addition, removal, and validation logic
- Integrates with save system for persistent storage
- Single responsibility: Character-specific inventory management

**InventorySubsystem** (World Subsystem)  
- Coordinates inventory operations across multiple characters
- Manages global inventory events and notifications
- Handles cross-character item transfers and trading
- Service pattern: Global inventory coordination

**InventoryManager** (Blueprint Class)
- Core logic for grid placement, stacking, and organization
- Implements spatial algorithms for optimal item placement
- Manages category-based filtering and sorting
- Algorithm encapsulation: Complex inventory logic centralized

### Data Management Strategy

**Item Data Architecture**
```
DA_ItemBase (Primary Data Asset):
- Core Properties: ID, Name, Description, Icon, Value
- Physical Properties: Stack Size, Grid Dimensions (Width x Height)
- Category: Equipment, Consumable, Material, Quest, Misc
- Restrictions: Usage Requirements, Level Locks, Class Locks

Item Instance Data:
- Unique Instance ID for save/load tracking
- Current Stack Count (if stackable item)
- Condition/Durability (for degradable items)
- Custom Properties (enchantments, modifications)
```

**Grid System Configuration**
- Dynamic grid sizing based on character progression
- Category-based auto-sorting with player override options
- Spatial optimization algorithms for automatic organization
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid placement zones

## Implementation Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Foundation

**1. Item Data Asset System**
- Create Item Base class: `DA_ItemBase` (Primary Data Asset)
- Define item categories with consistent property sets
- Setup item validation rules and usage constraints
- Create item database with efficient lookup systems

**2. Grid Architecture Setup**
- Design grid coordinate system (X, Y positioning)
- Implement spatial collision detection for item placement
- Create visual grid representation with UI binding
- Setup drag preview system with snap-to-grid functionality

**3. Inventory Component Creation**
- Build core inventory logic: Add, Remove, Move, Stack operations
- Implement capacity management with weight and slot limits
- Add category-based organization with filtering options
- Create event system for inventory change notifications

### Phase 2: UI Integration

**4. MVVM Implementation**  
- Create Inventory ViewModel with observable properties
- Bind inventory data to UI widgets reactively
- Implement drag-and-drop with visual feedback
- Add tooltip system with rich item information display

**5. Advanced UI Features**
- Quick-use slots with hotkey binding integration
- Search and filter functionality for large inventories
- Batch operations: multi-select, mass transfer, auto-sort
- Context menus with item-specific actions

### Phase 3: System Integration

**6. Cross-System Connectivity**
- Integrate with crafting system for material management
- Connect to trading system for multiplayer item exchange
- Link with loot system for automatic item acquisition
- Coordinate with save system for persistent inventory state

## Performance Optimization

### Spatial Algorithms
- **Efficient Placement**: Binary space partitioning for item positioning
- **Smart Stacking**: Automatic stack consolidation and optimization
- **Grid Optimization**: Lazy loading for large inventory spaces
- **Visual Culling**: Only render visible inventory sections

### Memory Management  
- **Item Instance Pooling**: Reuse item objects to prevent garbage collection
- **Lazy Loading**: Load item details only when needed for display
- **Soft References**: Heavy item assets (meshes, textures) loaded on-demand
- **Data Compression**: Efficient serialization for save operations

### UI Performance
- **Virtualized Lists**: Handle thousands of items without performance loss
- **Progressive Rendering**: Smooth scrolling with incremental item loading
- **Event Batching**: Group multiple inventory changes into single UI updates
- **Texture Streaming**: Dynamic icon loading based on inventory view

## Testing & Validation

### Functional Testing Matrix
- [ ] Item placement validation across all grid configurations
- [ ] Stacking behavior with various item types and limits
- [ ] Drag-and-drop accuracy with edge case positioning
- [ ] Category filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Save/load persistence across game sessions
- [ ] Integration testing with crafting and trading systems

### Performance Benchmarks
- **UI Responsiveness**: <16ms for all inventory operations
- **Memory Usage**: <5MB for 1000+ item inventories  
- **Search Performance**: <100ms for filtered results in large inventories
- **Save/Load Time**: <2 seconds for complete inventory serialization

### User Experience Validation
- **Intuitive Organization**: Players can organize items logically
- **Quick Access**: Frequently used items easily accessible
- **Visual Clarity**: Item information clearly displayed and readable
- **Error Prevention**: Invalid operations prevented with clear feedback
