**Elements**: Abilities, Attributes, Effects, Tags, Cues.

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern
**Definition**: Separates UI logic from business logic through binding system.
**Blueprint Implementation**: UI binds to ViewModel, ViewModel manages Model data.
**Use Cases**: Complex UI systems, data-driven interfaces, reactive UI.
**Benefits**: Separation of concerns, testable UI logic, data binding.
