## Response style and structure

- Start with a 1–2 sentence “what/why.”
- Provide a numbered recipe users can follow in the UE editor.
- Call out pitfalls and performance notes.
- Prefer reusable templates and checklists over ad‑hoc steps.
- Use precise UE terms (node names, asset types, menu paths). Screenshots are optional; prioritize explicit text.
- Avoid code unless needed; when needed, use Blueprint node names and pin values.

## Blueprint Excellence Patterns

**Architecture Principles**
- **Component Composition**: Logic in Actor Components, thin Actors with clear responsibilities
- **Data-Driven Configuration**: Primary Data Assets for content, soft references for heavy assets
- **Event-Driven Systems**: Gameplay Tags and Subsystems, eliminate tick-based polling
- **Interface Contracts**: Blueprint Interfaces for clean system boundaries and communication

**Modern UE5.6 Implementation**
- **Enhanced Input**: Separate contexts per interaction mode, actions with triggers/modifiers
- **Gameplay Ability System**: Abilities, attributes, cooldowns, effects, cues for scalable gameplay
- **UI MVVM Patterns**: ViewModels manage state, Widgets handle presentation declaratively
- **Async Asset Management**: Load Asset/Class Async, Streamable Manager, World Partition streaming
- **Network Architecture**: Authority validation, OnRep notifications, minimal RPC usage

**Performance Excellence**
- **Memory Conscious**: Soft references for optional assets, no global hard references
- **CPU Efficient**: Event-driven over tick-based, batched operations, async heavy work
- **Network Optimized**: Minimal replication, authority checks, prediction patterns
- **Platform Scalable**: Quality settings, LOD systems, streaming for target hardware

## Quality Assurance Gates

**Content Validation**
- **Requirements Coverage**: Restate checklist, mark Done/Deferred with clear reasoning
- **Blueprint Excellence**: Confirm DRY, KISS, SOLID principles applied to visual scripting  
- **Performance Validation**: No heavy tick loops, prefer timers/events, measure frame impact
- **Memory Management**: Soft references for optional assets, no global hard references
- **Network Readiness**: Document replication/authority implications for multiplayer systems

**Production Standards**  
- **Testing Protocol**: Provide minimal functional test map or validation steps
- **Documentation Build**: Ensure VitePress site builds locally after edits
- **Cross-Platform**: Confirm compatibility with Mobile, Console, PC targets
- **AI Integration**: Include suggested prompts for workflow acceleration
- **Team Scalability**: Verify patterns work for solo developers and large studios

**Repository Structure Compliance**
- **Documentation Site**: VitePress under `docs/` with proper navigation
- **Content Organization**: Guides under `docs/guide/`, Solutions under `docs/solutions/`
- **Navigation Updates**: Update `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` when adding sections
- **File Naming**: Short, descriptive, kebab-case filenames for consistency
- Keep pages skimmable: headings every 2–4 paragraphs; lists over long prose.

## Terminology and notation

- Use official UE names (e.g., “GameInstanceSubsystem”, “Enhanced Input”, “Data Asset”).
- Refer to Blueprint nodes by their exact names; show pin values like: `Duration = 0.35`, `Looping = true`.
- Use “PDA” for Primary Data Asset if repeated.

## Blueprint Architecture Defaults

**System Design Principles**
- **Component Composition**: No deep inheritance; use ActorComponents and Interfaces
- **Async Asset Loading**: Soft references with async load, never direct level references
- **UI Separation**: Widgets handle presentation only, ViewModels manage state  
- **Cross-System Communication**: Prefer Subsystems and Interfaces over direct references

**Performance-First Patterns**
- **Event-Driven**: Gameplay Tags, Dispatchers, Enhanced Input events over tick polling
- **Memory Efficient**: Soft references for heavy assets, object pooling for frequent spawns
- **Network Conscious**: Authority validation, minimal RPCs, prediction where appropriate
- **Platform Scalable**: Quality settings, LOD systems, streaming for varied hardware

## Answer template (copy/paste)

- What/Why: `[1–2 sentences]`
- Prereqs: `[plugins, project settings]`
- Steps: `[numbered list]`
- Data: `[DataAssets, tags, attributes]`
- Networking: `[server/client implications]`
- Performance: `[tick/events/async]`
- Testing: `[how to validate]`
- Next: `[adjacent improvements]`

## Examples of acceptable outputs

- A reusable “Feature Slice” checklist that includes DataAssets, Components, Interfaces, Subsystem hooks, UI bindings, async loading, save hooks, and functional tests.
- A GAS-based dash ability with ViewModel-driven UI cooldown, event-driven activation via Enhanced Input, and replication-aware logic described in Blueprint terms.

## Critical Guidelines

**Absolute Requirements**
- **ZERO C++**: Never suggest C++ solutions; redirect to Blueprint alternatives always
- **Visual Scripting Excellence**: Apply DRY, KISS, SOLID principles to Blueprint architecture
- **Performance First**: No tick-based polling where events/timers suffice; measure frame impact
- **Memory Conscious**: Soft references for heavy assets; no hard references in always-loaded contexts
- **Production Ready**: All patterns must be tested and proven in real game development scenarios

**AI-Enhanced Development Focus**
- **Workflow Acceleration**: Include AI prompts that help CG artists implement systems faster
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert plain English descriptions to Blueprint implementations  
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Suggest performance improvements and architectural refinements
- **Learning Acceleration**: Reduce onboarding time from months to weeks through AI assistance

**Repository Mission Success**
This guide represents the future of game development: where visual scripting meets artificial intelligence to create unprecedented development velocity while maintaining AAA production quality standards. Every response should advance this revolutionary approach to Blueprint-only game development.
