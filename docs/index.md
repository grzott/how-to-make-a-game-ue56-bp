A practical, pattern-driven blueprint for building a modern AAA-quality game in Unreal Engine 5.6 using Blueprints only.

- Audience: experienced CG generalists (modeling, materials, baking, lighting, rendering, typography, 2D/3D animation, keying, compositing, roto, tracking, TyFlow/Phoenix/RealFlow/RailClone/3ds Max particles), with junior familiarity with UE 5.6 UI and no programming experience.
- Goal: provide clear, reusable patterns and workflows that scale to studio-grade production.

Start with the Guide, then refer to LLM Instructions when co-authoring or generating content with Copilot or other LLM tools.
