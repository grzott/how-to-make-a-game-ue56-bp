# Production Pipeline: CI/CD & Team Workflows (Blueprint)

What/Why: Enterprise-grade Blueprint development with automated validation, team collaboration patterns, and production-ready deployment pipelines.

Prereqs

- Source control: Perforce or Git with LFS for large assets
- Build automation: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar CI/CD system
- Team size: 5+ developers working on Blueprint systems

Steps

1. Blueprint Version Control Patterns

- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Use `Blueprint Diff Tool` for visual merging
- **Atomic Commits**: Group related Blueprint changes with data assets and dependencies
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for major systems, daily integration to main
- **Large Binary Handling**: Use Git LFS or Perforce for .uasset files >10MB

2. Automated Blueprint Validation

- **Build Pipeline Step 1**: Compile all Blueprints with `-NoShaderCompile` for fast iteration
- **Build Pipeline Step 2**: Run `Blueprint Nativization` equivalent - validate no compilation errors
- **Build Pipeline Step 3**: Execute Functional Tests on headless build
- **Quality Gates**: Fail build on Blueprint compilation errors or test failures

3. Blueprint Code Review Standards

- **Architecture Review**: Component composition, interface usage, event flow
- **Performance Review**: Tick usage, array iterations, expensive operations
- **Network Review**: Authority patterns, replication setup, RPC validation
- **Naming Review**: Consistent prefixes, clear variable names, documentation

4. Automated Testing Integration

- **Unit Tests**: Blueprint function validation with known inputs/outputs
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-Blueprint system tests (interaction + inventory)
- **Performance Tests**: Frame time validation under load, memory leak detection
- **Platform Tests**: Cross-platform Blueprint behavior validation

5. Blueprint Analytics and Telemetry

- **Build Metrics**: Compilation time, Blueprint complexity, dependency graphs
- **Runtime Metrics**: Blueprint execution time, memory usage, crash reports
- **Team Metrics**: Blueprint authoring velocity, review cycle times, bug rates
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, performance regression detection

6. Production Deployment Pipeline

- **Staging Builds**: Full game builds with Blueprint profiling enabled
- **Performance Validation**: Automated benchmarks on target hardware
- **Content Validation**: Asset cooking validation, missing reference detection
- **Release Builds**: Optimized Blueprint compilation, shipping configurations

7. Team Collaboration Tools

- **Blueprint Documentation**: Automated generation from Blueprint comments
- **Dependency Tracking**: Visual graphs of Blueprint system interdependencies
- **Performance Dashboard**: Real-time Blueprint performance metrics across team
- **Knowledge Base**: Blueprint patterns, anti-patterns, team coding standards

Data

- `DA_TeamStandards`: Blueprint complexity limits, naming conventions, performance budgets
- Build configuration assets: platform-specific compilation settings, optimization levels

Networking

- **Multi-Branch Testing**: Validate Blueprint networking across feature branches
- **Load Testing**: Automated multiplayer stress tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Cross-Platform Net**: Validate Blueprint replication across different platforms

Performance

- **Build Time Budget**: Total Blueprint compilation <5 minutes for CI/CD
- **Test Execution**: Automated test suite runs in <10 minutes
- **Deployment Time**: Production builds complete in <30 minutes

Testing

- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Local Blueprint compilation validation before push
- **Continuous Integration**: Every commit triggers Blueprint validation pipeline
- **Nightly Builds**: Full game builds with comprehensive Blueprint testing
- **Release Candidates**: Multi-platform validation with performance benchmarking

## Advanced Team Patterns

1. Blueprint Refactoring at Scale

- **Dependency Analysis**: Map all Blueprint references before major changes
- **Refactoring Tools**: Custom editor scripts for bulk Blueprint updates
- **Migration Patterns**: Versioned Blueprint interfaces for backward compatibility
- **Impact Assessment**: Automated analysis of Blueprint change ripple effects

2. Blueprint Performance Governance

- **Performance Budgets**: Per-Blueprint execution time limits enforced in CI
- **Regression Detection**: Automated performance comparison between builds
- **Hot Path Analysis**: Identify critical Blueprint execution paths for optimization
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Automated testing for Blueprint object lifecycle issues

3. Cross-Platform Blueprint Validation

- **Platform-Specific Testing**: Validate Blueprint behavior on iOS, Android, Console, PC
- **Performance Scaling**: Automated quality preset validation per platform
- **Compatibility Testing**: Blueprint API changes across UE versions
- **Device-Specific Testing**: Blueprint performance on minimum specification hardware

## Production Monitoring and Observability

1. Runtime Blueprint Monitoring

- **Performance Telemetry**: Real-time Blueprint execution metrics in live games
- **Error Reporting**: Automated crash reports from Blueprint execution failures
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which Blueprint systems are used most frequently
- **A/B Testing**: Blueprint variant testing with performance and engagement metrics

2. Development Team Dashboards

- **Build Health**: Blueprint compilation success rates across team and branches
- **Code Quality**: Blueprint complexity metrics, review cycle times, technical debt
- **Performance Trends**: Long-term Blueprint performance regression tracking
- **Team Velocity**: Blueprint development productivity and delivery metrics
