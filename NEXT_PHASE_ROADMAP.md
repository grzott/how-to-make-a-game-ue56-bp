## Phase Transition Decision

**Ready to proceed with S++ Phase?**

This next phase will establish this guide as the definitive industry reference - not just following best practices, but creating them. We'll be implementing patterns that most studios won't adopt for 2-3 years.

**Key Questions:**

1. Focus on AI integration first (Sprint 1)?
2. Target specific next-gen platforms (VisionPro, Neural interfaces)?
3. Emphasize research/innovation vs practical implementation?

**Recommendation:** Start with AI-Powered Blueprint Development (Sprint 1) as it provides immediate value while establishing the foundation for more advanced patterns.
