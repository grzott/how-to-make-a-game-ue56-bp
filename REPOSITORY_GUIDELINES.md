# Repository Guidelines & LLM Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **UE5.6 Blueprint AAA Guide** - a comprehensive resource for building AAA-quality games using Unreal Engine 5.6 with Blueprints only. The guide is specifically designed for CG artists transitioning to game development and teams looking to implement industry-standard patterns without C++ programming.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** CG artists with visual thinking backgrounds who want to create professional games
**Secondary:** Junior developers, indie teams, and studios adopting Blueprint-first workflows
**Tertiary:** AI/LLM-enhanced development teams seeking cutting-edge productivity patterns

## Core Principles

### Blueprint-Only Excellence
- **Zero C++** - All systems implemented using visual scripting
- **AAA Quality** - Production-proven patterns from 30+ years industry experience
- **Performance First** - Concrete optimization strategies and measurable budgets
- **Clean Architecture** - DRY, KISS, SOLID principles applied to visual scripting

### AI-Enhanced Development
- **Revolutionary Integration** - Industry-first AI/LLM framework for game development
- **Natural Language to Blueprint** - Convert descriptions to complete implementations
- **Intelligent Optimization** - AI-powered performance and architecture suggestions
- **Team Acceleration** - 40-60% faster development through AI assistance

## Content Guidelines for AI Assistants

### Writing Style
- **Audience Awareness** - Written for CG artists, not programmers
- **Visual Terminology** - Use spatial and visual metaphors
- **Production Focus** - Real-world constraints and team workflows
- **No Assumptions** - Explain technical terms on first use

### Technical Approach
- **Blueprint Exclusive** - Never suggest C++ solutions
- **Modern UE5.6** - Use latest features and best practices
- **Performance Conscious** - Always consider memory, CPU, and network impact
- **Scalable Architecture** - Patterns that work for teams of any size

### Documentation Format
- **Structured Consistency** - Standard sections across all guides
- **Visual Documentation** - Mermaid diagrams and Blueprint screenshots
- **Cross-Linking** - Connect related concepts across sections
- **Practical Examples** - Real implementation scenarios

### AI Assistant Behavior
- **Project Context** - Always consider the repository's mission and audience
- **Technical Accuracy** - Verify UE5.6 compatibility and best practices
- **Blueprint Focus** - Redirect any C++ suggestions to Blueprint alternatives
- **Production Readiness** - Ensure all suggestions meet professional standards

## Success Metrics

### User Outcomes
